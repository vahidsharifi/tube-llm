Response:  {'question': ['how to fine-tune llama-2'], 'answer': ['To fine-tune llama-2, you need to use Q Laura and push the model to the Hugging Face Model Hub. You can start by showing a quick demo and then proceed to fine-tune llama-2 based on a specific dataset, such as French quotes. After fine-tuning, you can use llama-2 to generate French text. To push the model to the Hugging Face Model Hub, you need to authenticate your notebook with your Hugging Face profile and then paste the access token. Once the model is pushed, it becomes available for use by yourself or others.'], 'sources': ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fsn19OI_C8, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeM6V5aPjhk']}

After fine-tuning, you can push the model to the hugging face model Hub, where you can have a repository with the lower adapters for later use. The process involves using a custom dataset in CSV format with three columns: instruction, input, and output.
