Response:  {'question': ['how to prevent hair recede?'], 'answer': ['To prevent hair recede, you can research and consider using minoxidil, finasteride, and biotin supplements. Minoxidil stimulates hair growth when applied topically, while finasteride prevents hair from falling and thinning. Consult a professional before starting finasteride due to potential side effects. Taking biotin supplements can also help. Additionally, increasing igf-1 levels through prescription drugs or saw palmetto can promote hair growth. Using Ketoconazole shampoo may also be effective. Lastly, managing stress and anxiety can prevent hair loss.'], 'sources': ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umIN_qg6blE, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZwGXMIsRX8']}
