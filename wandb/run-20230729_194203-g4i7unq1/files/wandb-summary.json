{"question": "how to fine-tune llama-2", "answer": "To fine-tune llama-2, you can use the efficient 4-bit Q lore quantization on Google Colab. Load the necessary libraries, then load and examine the llama-2 model. Use a custom dataset, such as an instruction dataset in CSV format, with columns for instruction, input, and output. Follow the provided code to fine-tune the model based on the dataset. Once fine-tuned, you can push the model to the Hugging Face model Hub.", "sources": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fsn19OI_C8", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5bU1H-6TqM", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeM6V5aPjhk"], "_timestamp": 1690656131.239383, "_runtime": 8.173131942749023, "_step": 0, "_wandb": {"runtime": 207}}
