You can create a repository in the model Hub and have the lower adapters there for later use. The process involves using a custom dataset in CSV format with three columns: instruction, input, and output. The instruction column provides the instructions for fine-tuning, while the input and output columns contain the corresponding input and output data.\", \"sources\": [\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeM6V5aPjhk\", \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fsn19OI_C8\"]}", "_timestamp": 1690656763.867244, "_runtime": 22.036820888519287, "_step": 1, "_wandb": {"runtime": 1037}}
